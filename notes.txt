Introduction :

We linked the React and ReactDOM files using CDN.
Created a Hello World using React.createElement() and it works

But this is not a production ready application. We need a lot of things like :

Server
Minification
Bundling
Image Optimization
Tree Shaking
Caching
A lot of other optimization

To acheive all of this, we need a lot of Packages/Dependicies. 
In order to manage these Packages, we need to use a package manager - npm
To use npm, we have to initialize our project with Node.
